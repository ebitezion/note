# note
A command line todo app developed in golang and mysql

It has a home page and details that allows user add, delete,update and view 
a ToDo list item by typing a command on the command
prompt.

It was created in some hours as a teaching aid for a friend, to demonstrate
some concept in go.

Feel free to update it as you choose, I would love to see your
Update too. Happy coding
